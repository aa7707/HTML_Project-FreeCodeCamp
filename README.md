# HTML_Project-FreeCodeCamp
This Repository contains the projects that i will make while learning responsive web development from FreeCodeCamp.
The reason behind creating another repository for web development while I already have one is because, well the youtube course doesn't provides certification, which i would require to showcase my knowledge about it, and will also help me get a job.
